      "post": "The use of Artificial Intelligence is becoming more widespread day by day. Nowadays, you can't do anything without seeing something made from AI. As someone who is a consumer of media such as television and social media, every time I see AI, I can't help but feel upset about how the creator didn't put any work into their creation.  
               Furthermore, Media made by AI is often given bad reviews, and companies that decide to use AI receive huge amounts of backlash. For example, Coca-Cola made a short Christmas commercial with AI in December 2024. The responses to it were anything but good, with many feeling upset and betrayed by a company that they used to respect. Do you think companies should continue to push the use of AI with the growing bad reputation it has?",
